    "description": "Shared items are any files or folders that are represented by a shared link. Shared items are different from other API resources in that a shared resource doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be in the account of the user accessing it. The actual shared link itself is used along with a normal access token.\nUsed to retrieve the metadata about a shared item when only given a shared link. Because of varying permission for shared links, a password may be required to retrieve the shared item. Once the item has been retrieved, you can make API requests against the actual resource /files/{id} or /folders/{id} as long as the shared link and optional password are in the header.",
