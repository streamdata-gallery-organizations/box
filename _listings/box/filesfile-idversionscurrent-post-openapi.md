  title: Box Promote Version
  description: If there are previous versions of this file, this method can be used
    to promote one of the older versions to the top of the stack. This actually mints
    a copy of the old version and puts it on the top of the versions stack. The file
    will have the exact same contents, the same SHA1/etag, and the same name as the
    original. Other properties such as comments do not get updated to their former
    values.

      summary: Update File Info, Lock and Unlock, Create Shared Link
      description: |-
        Used to update individual or multiple fields in the file object, including renaming the file, changing its description, and creating a shared link for the file. To move a file, change the ID of its parent folder. An optional If-Match header can be included to prevent race conditions.

        To lock and unlock files, you execute a PUT operation on the /files/{file id} endpoint and set or clear the lock properties on the file.

        Used to create a shared link for this particular file. Please see here for more information on the permissions available for shared links. In order to get default shared link status, set it to an empty access level, i.e. {"shared_link": {}}. In order to disable a shared link, send this same type of PUT request with the value of shared_link set to null, i.e. {"shared_link": null}
